Installing assemblaLib.

Tip: place all the downloaded projects in the same root directory, this way no makefile variables need be edited and the python path needs to be pointed at this base directory.

(1) Download and install cactus.

(2) Compile the C code:
Modify the rootPath variable in the src/Makefile to point at where you installed cactus.
In the base directory type 'make all'
